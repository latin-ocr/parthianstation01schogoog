COMMENTARY

The Parthian Stations ol Isidore ol Charax, fragmentary as it is,
is one of the very few records of the overland trade-route in the period
of struggle between Parthia 3ηά Rome. As the title indicates, it gives
an itinerary ol the caravan trail from Antioch to the borders ol India,
naming the supply stations, or, as they would now be called, the
caravanserais maintained by the Parthian Government for the con-
venience ol merchants. While the record contains little more than
the names ol the stations and the intervening distances, an examina-
tion ol the route followed leads to numerous inferences concerning
the relations ol the Parthian monarchy with its subject states and with
neighboring foreign powers.

ThIs record may be dated from internal evidence as of the reign
ol Augustus probably very close to the Christian era. In its manu-
script form, the Parthian Stations seems to be a mere summary or
transcription lrom some larger work, and another extract quoted by
Athenaeus 3ηά ascribed to Isidore, mentions the title asa “Journey
around Parthia,'' while various fragments quoted in the Natural History
ol Pliny indicate that Isidore was the author ol some general work
on geography. His very home isa matter of inference. The manu-
script speaks ol him as Isidore “oi Charax‚'' which means merely
“ palisaded town.” But it seems clear that the place meant is Charax
, Spasini, the commercia] port at the head of the Persian Gall, and C.
Miiller points out that the author of the “description of the world ”A
mentioned by Pliny (Vl, 31) as having been commissioned by Augustus
“to gather all necessary information in the east when his eldest son
was about to set out lor Armenia to take the command against the
Parthians and Arabians,'' is no other than our Isidore. The manu-
script of Pliny in that place refers this work to Dionysius, but asboth
Miiller and Bernhardy have shown, this is a mistake and Isidore is
probably meant.

As to the date of the work of Isidore, as it mentions the second
revolution of Tiridates against the Parthian king PhraateS, which took
place in 26 B. C.‚ it must be later than that date; anda subsequent
reference to a kiug named Goaesus oi the “ lucense Land '' in South
Arabia, while his dates are not definitely known, suggests as Glaser
has shown, a time very near the Christian era.
