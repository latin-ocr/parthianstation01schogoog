· Strabo says of this region generally (XV, 2-8):

, ·“·The greater part of. the. country inhabited hythe Icthyophagi
is ona level with the sea. No trees except palms 3ηά 3 kind of thom,1
and the tamarisk grow there, There is also a scarcity ο1 ¹water and
ol lood produced by cultivation. Both they and their cattle subsist
upon fish and are supplied by rain water and wells. The flesh of the
animals has the smell of fish. Their dwellings are xbuilt with the*

“ bones of large whales and sheIIS, the ribs fumishing beanis'and sup-
ports, and the law-bones door-ways. The vertebral bones serve as
mortars in which fish, which have been previously dried in the sun,
are pounded. Of this, with the addition ο1 fiour, calces are made 3¹
for they have'grinding mills (for corn), although th'ey have no iron·
This, however, is not so surprising, because it is possible for‘them' to
import it from other parts. But how do they hollow out the mills
again when worn away? With the same stones‚ they say, with ¹which
their arrowsand iavelins, which are hardened in the fire are sharpened.
Some ,fish are dressed in novem, but the greater part is eaten raw. The
fish are taken in nets made ο1 the bark of the palm.

“ Above the lcthyophagi is situated Gedrosia (Mithran), aedun-
try less exposed to the heat ol the sun than India, but more so· than
the rest of Asia. As it· is without iniits and water, except in summer,
it is not much better than the country of the icthyophagi.w‚, Butit
produces aromatics, particularly nard and myrrh, in such quantity that
the army of Alexander used them on the march for tent coverings and
beds; they thus breathed an air full 'of odors, and at the same time
more salubrious.

“The summer was purposelychosen for leaving India, for at,
that season it rains in Gedrosia, and the rivers 3ηά wells are filled, but
in winter they fail. The rain falls in the higher parts to the north,
and near the mountains3 whc'n the rivers fill, the plains near the sea
are watered, and the wells are also filled. Alexander sent persons
before him into the desert country to dig wells and to prepare stations.
for himself and his lieet. ,

“ Having separated his forces into three divisions, he set outwith
one division through Gedrosia, keeping at the utmost from the sea not
more than 500 stadia, in order tosecure the coast for his fleet3 but he
frequently approached the sea-side, although the beach was impractic·
able and rugged. The second division he sent forward under the'
command of Craterus through the interior, with aview of reducing
Ariana, and ο1 proceeding to the same places to which he was himself·
directing his march. The third division, the fleet,=he intrusted ‘td
