route sketched by Isidore, ending at Antioch3 and 'it' is interesting to ·
note that the Parthian route includesthe spa'ce between Kandaharand
Lake Helmund, which had also to be traveled by those bound for the
Persian Gull. It is clear that the southern kingdoms tributary to the
Parthian state were in large measure independens in their commercial ·
affairs, and that some understanding to this effect 'existed with the
Parthian capital; otherwise the diversion of trade between the northern
and southern routes at Lake Helmund could not peacefully have
occurred*

The Parthian Stations marks the ancient trade-route of the Medes
and the Assyrians. The rise of the power of Persia diverted much '
of the trade to the Royal Road, leading to Susa and thence to Lake
Helmund. Under the Parthians it was evidently a¹ state policy to
encourage the passage of goods from Lake Helmund over the old
, northern route; but the understanding between the Kushan monarchy
and the Nabataean princes made it impracticable for Parthia to

, establish a commercia] monopoly through its capital on the Tigris.

We may infer that the author ol the Journey Aroand Parthia,
meaning the Parthian Empire, described both these important over-
land highways. lt is' very regrettable that his work should have
perished except in fugitive quotatiom, and that we have remaining ’
only a brief itinerary of the northern route.

The policy of the Roman Empire during the· two centuries
following the Christian era was to encourage direct sea trade with
India, cutting out all overland routes through Parthia and thus avoiding
the annoyance of fiscal dependence on that consistent enemy of Rome.

ln connection with the work of Isidore, the relations between
Parthia and Rome immediately preceding his time may be borne in
' mind. When Crassus became consul in Rome in 55 Β. C., he was
appointed to command in the east, his headquarters being at Antioch,
the former Seleucid capital; and he announced his intention of carry- ,
ing the Roman arms to Bactria, lndia and the eastern ocean. The
Arab sheikhs bordering on the province of Syria, some of whom had
been allied with Rome, changed sides as they did not desire further
aggressions from the west. Crassus crossed the Euphrates at Zeugma,
where the Parthian Stations begins its account. Instead of following
the road to Edessa and Armenia at the foot of the hills or keeping
close to the Euphrates river, he marched straight overland, still along

*In the Shah Numa the contempt of Persia for the Parthians is evident3
“the throne did not belong to any une ’⁸ and “men said that they had no longer
a kingdom on the earth ''.
