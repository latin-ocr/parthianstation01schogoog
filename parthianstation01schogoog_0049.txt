and soldiers. On its eastern frontier i's the city ol Mu-lu (Moutu,
Merv) which is called Little Parthia. lt is 20,000 li distant from
Lo-yang. ln the first year ol Chang-ho, ol the Emperor Chang-ti ,
(87 A. D.) they sent an embassy offering lions andfu-pa. The su-pa
has the shape of a unicorn, but 'has no horn. In the 9th year ol
Yung-yiian of Ho-ti (97 Α. D.) the general Pan Ch'ao sent Kan-ying
as an ambassador to Ta·ts' in, who arrived in T’iao-chih, on the coast
of the great sea. When about to take his passage across the sea, the
sailors of the western frontier ol Parthia told Kan-ying: ‘The sea is
vast and great3 with lavorable winds it is possible to cross within three
months; but il you meet slow winds, it may also take you two years.
lt is lor this reason that those who go to sea take on board a supply of
three years’ provisions. There is something in the sea which is apt
to make a man home-sick, and several have thus lost their lives'
When Kan-ying heard this, he stopped . . . .

“ln the 13th year (101 A. D.) the king of Parthia, Man-k'ii

(Pacorusi) again offered as tribute lions and large birds from

T'iao-chih (ostriches)‚ which henceforth were named An-lsi-chiao

“The country of Ta·ts'in (Syria) is also called Li-chien (Li-kin,
Re-kam, Petra) and, as being situated on the western part of the sea,
Hai-hsi-kuo (country ol the western part ol thesea). Its territory

amounts to several thousand li; it contains over four hundred cities,
and of dependent states there are several times ten . . . ‚s . The
country contains much gold, silver and rare precious stones,''. .,. . .
corals‚ amba, glass, . . . . . gold-embroidered rugs and thin silk
cloth of various colors. They make gold-colored cloth and asbestos
cloth. They further have ‘fine cloth‚' also called ‘down ol the
water sheep'; it is made from the ‘cocoons ol wild silk-worms. They
collect all kinds of fiagrant substances‚ the juice of which they boil
into su-lzo (storax). All the rare gems ol other foreign countries
come from there. They make coins ol gold and silver. Ten units
of silver are worth one of gold. They traffic by sea with Parthia and
India, the profit of which trade is ten-lold. They are honest in their

transactions, and there are no double prices. . . . Their kings ’

always desired to send embassies to Chim, but the Parthians wished
to carry on trade with them in Chinese silks, and it is for this reason
that they were cut off from communication. This lasted till the ninth
year ol the Yen-hsi period during the Empeor Huan-ti’s reign

(166 A. D.) when the king of Ta·ts’in, An-tun (Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus) sent an embassy who from the frontier ol Jih-nan (Annam)
