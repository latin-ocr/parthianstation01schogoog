F ROM ISlDORE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE W-ORLD

21. (Pliny, Natural History, ΙΙ, 112.) “Our part ol the
earth, ol which l propose to give an account, floating as it
were in the ocean which surrounds it, stretches out to the
greatest extent lrorn east to west, via, from India to the .
Pillars consecrated to Hercules at Gades, being adistance ol
8568 miles, according to the statement ol Artemidorus, or
according to that ol Isidore, 9818 miles.''

22. (Ibid.,11, 112.) “The breadth ol the earth from south
’ to north, is commonly supposed to be about one-hall only ol
its length, via, 4490 miles;'' (then lollow parts ol these
measurements lrorn the southern extremities to the mouth ol
Tanais). “Beyond the Tanais the most diligent authors have

not been able to obtain any accurate measurement. Artemi· '

dorus supposes that everything beyond is undiscovered, since
he confessos that, about the Tanais, the tribes ol the Sarmatae
dwell, who extend toward the North Pole. Isidore adds 1250
miles, as the distance to Thule; but this is mere conjecture.’'

23. (Ilia, V, 9.) “The whole distance (ol Asia) to the
Tanais, including Egypt, is, according to Artemidorus and ·
Isidore, 6375 miles.

24. (Ibid.,1V, 37.) “Artemidorus and Isidore have given
the length ol it (Europe) irom the Tanais to Gades, as 8214
miles.’'

25. (Ibid.,V, 6.) “Isidore speaks ol the distance irom

Tingi to Canopus as being 3599 miles. Artemidorus makes
this last distance lorty miles less than Isidore.’'

26. (Ibid. V, 43.) “From Chalcedon toSigeum, Isidore '
makes the distance 322 ½ miles.'’

27. (Ibit, V, 35.) “Timosthenes states that the circum-
lerence ol this island [Cyprus] is 427 miles, Isidore 375’.”

28. (Ilia, V, 36.) “The lairest ol them all is the lree

island ol Rhodes, 125, or il we would rather believe Isidore,
103 miles in circumference ....... Itis distant lrom
Alexandria in Egypt, according to Isidore, 588 miles; but ac-
cording to Eratosthenes, 469. Mucianus says that its distance
horn Cyprus is 166.”’
