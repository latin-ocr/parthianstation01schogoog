ἓ Ι. SELEUCIA on the Tigris.

Strabo says: “ ln tormer times the capital ol Assyria was Babylon 3

it is now called Seleucia upon the Tigris. Near it is a large village
called Ctesiphon. This the Parthian kings usually made their winter
residence‚ with a view to sparing the Seleucians the burden ol furnish-
ing quarters lor the Scythian soldiery. In consequence ol the power
ol Parthia, Ctesiphon may be considered as a city rather thana
village3 from its size it is capable ol lodging a great multitude ol
people; it has been adorned with public buildings by the Parthians
and has lurnished merchandise and given vise to arts profitable to its
masters. The kings usually passed the winter there, on account ol
the salubrity of the air, and the summer at Ecbatana and in Hyrcania,

about 300 stadia.

“Both this prince and all his successors directed their care 'to
that city, and transferred to it the seat ol empire. At present it is
larger than Babylon, which is in great part deserted .....

the houses are made ol palm wood. They windropes ol twisted
reed round the pillars, paint them over with colors and draw designs
upon them3 they cover the doors witha coat ol asphaltum. These
are lolty and all the houses are vaulted on account ol the want ol
timber. For the country is bare; a great part ol it is covered with
shrubs and produces nothing but the palm. This tree grows in the
greatest abundance in Babylonia ..... They do not use tiles lor
their houses, because there are no great rains. (XVl, l, 5.)

“The country is intersected by many rivers, the largest ol which
arc the Euphrates and the Tigris ..... The Tigris is navigable
