The location ol these tribes shows clearly the racc migrations
that occurrod between the time ol Eratosthenes and that of Isidore.
The Sacae, which he has east ol the Iaxartes, the modern Syr-Dana,
Isidore has settled in the Helmund Valley. The Sogdiani, whom
Eratosthenes places between the Sacae and the Oxus (the modern
Amu-Daria) have likewise moved south and west and m lsidore’s
timeare under the dominion ol the Kushan kings in Bactria.

The Arachosii appear in the Periplus about A. D. 80 as one ol
the tribes inland lrom the Indus Valley‚ north ol whom were the
“nation ol the Bactrians '', by which was meant the Kushan do-
minions.

The Periplus has an interesting note ol the commercial import-
, ance ol the Greek civilization in that regin, when it speaks ol the
silver coins ol the Greek dynasty in Bactria as still current in the
ports ol the Cambay region, more than 200 years· alter they were issued.

The lact that through the province ol Arachosia runs one ol the
principal trade routes between Persia and India made it always politi-
cally important and commercially prosperous.

The following references lrorn the Periplus are ol interest in
connection with the itinerary ol Isidore:

by numerous tribes, such as the Amuli, the Arachosii, the Gandaraei
