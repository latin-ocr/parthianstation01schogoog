Nearchus and Onesicritus, his master pilot, giving them orders to take
up convenient positions in following him, and to sail along the coast
parallel to his lincol march.'' ⁴

ln another section (XV, 2, 5), Strabo observes:

“Nearchus says that while Alexander was on his march, he him-
sell commenced his voyage, in the autumn„about the achronical rising
ol the Pleiades, the wind not being belore favorable. The Barbarians ι
however, taking courage at the departure ol the king, became daring,
and attempted to throw off their subjection, attacked them and
endeavored to drive them out ol the country. But Craterus set out
lrom the Hydaspes, and proceeded through the country of the Ara-
choti and ol the Drangae into Carmania. ’

“Alexander was greatly distressed throughout the whole march,
as hls road lay through a barren country. The supplies of provisions
which he obtained came from a distance and were scanty and un-
lrequent, so much so that the army suffered greatly from hunger, the
beasts ol burden dropped down and the baggage was abandoned, both
on the march and in the camp. The army was saved by eating dates
and the marrow ol the palm tree.

“ lexander, however (says Nearchus), although acquainted with
the hardships ol the enterprise, was ambitious ol conducting this large
army in salety, as a conqueror, through the same country where, ac-
cording to the prevailing report, Semiramis escaped by llight from
lndia with about twerity and Cyrus with about seven men. ’'

This is the modern trade route lrom Afghanistan by Lake Hel-
mund and ‘Kerman to the head ol the Persian Gull.

Strabo, (Xl, 8, 8-9) further observes:

“Eratosthenes says that the Bactrians lie along the Arachoti and
Massagetae on the west near the Oxus, andthat the Sacae and Sogdiani,
through the whole extent ol their territory, are opposite to India, but ¹
the Bactrii in part only, lor the greater part of their country lies
parallel to the Parapamisus; that the Sacae and Sogdiani are separated
by the Iaxartes, and the Sogdiani and Bactriani by the Oxus, that
Tapyri occupy the country between the Hyrcani and Arii; that around ·
the shores of the sea, next to the Hyrcani, are Amardi, Anariacae,
Cadusii, Albani, Caspii, Vitii, and perhaps other tribes extending as
lar asthe Scythians; that on the other side ol the Hyrcani are Derbices,
that the Caducii are contiguous both to the Medes and Matiani below
the Parachoathras.
