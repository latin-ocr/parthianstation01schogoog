the high-road to Edessa and Armenia. After crossing the Euphrates
the Parthian route made a direct line, avoiding the long bend in the
river, which it reached lower down and followed until Neapolis,
where it left the Euphrates and crossed overland to Seleucia on the
Tigris. Thence it ascended the hills of Media, crossed the Caspian
Gates, and followed the fertile valleys eastward through the modern
Khorassan to the Herat river. Here, instead of proceeding eastward
to Bactria and the Pamirs, the Parthian route turned southward to
Lake Helmund and Kandahar, where the record ends. ’

If the route laid down in the Parthian Stations was the high-road
of commerce under the Parthian Empire, ·it suggests not only a
thorough regulation of commerce throughout its own dominions, but
also a lack of trade control in other states generally counted as tributary
to the Parthians, who evidently attended to their own commercial
affairs. Isidore speaks of the two revolts against Phraates who, we
are told by various Roman historians, was expelled from the capital
and forced to fiee to the Scythians, by whom he was given aid,
returned and reestablished himself on his throne. The Scythian king
is not named, buthe probably ruled over the Saka Scythians, who had
been driven westward from Chinese territory by the Yue-chi, who
had set up in the former Greek kingdom of Bactria a powerful king-
dom under the Kushan dynasty some fifty years before lsidore’s time. ’
The Saka tribes had migrated ahead ofthe Yue-chi and had settled
in the Helmund valley‚ acknowledging some sort of dependence upon
the Parthian dynasty. ln Indian history we find the Indo-Parthians
overrunning the Cambay district in the first century A. D. and acom-
bination known in Indian records as Sakas, Yavanas and PallavaS,
raiding much farther south in the two centuries following. These
are no doubt the same tribes that lent aid to Phraates against his
rebellious subjects. The subservience of the Saka Scythians to the
Parthian dynasty must have been little more than nominal. Their
chieftains in India acknowledged the over-lordship vof the Kushan
monarchies and they seem to have been free lances. ln matters com-
mercial we may infer that they not only served as the eastern terminus
’ of the Parthian trade route, but that they cooperated with the Kushan
kings in maintaining trade relations through Carmania and Persia with
the Arab states of Mesene and Characene at the head of the Persian

Gulf. Along this route atrade in Chinese silks was carried on between
the Pamirs and Charax Spasini, whence the merchandise went by sail-
ing vessels around Arabia, and finally reached the Levant through the
mart of Petra. Such trade as passed through Parthia and came
directly under the control of the Parthian monarchy went over the
