‘⁴ ln the Shaih Nama Sistin is the home of the famous family oi
champions, who seated the Keianian dynasty on the throne of Persia.
Their most brilliant scion was Rustam, whose matchless daring forms
the main theme ol Firdusi's great epic, and who is as much the
national hero to-day as he was a thousand years or more ago, every-
thing in Persia that is not understood, such as the Sassanian rock

sculptores at Persepolis, being attributed to this champion, who like Ι ’

the Homeric heroes, was as mightya trencherman as warrior, and
almost equally respected lor his prowess in both fields.

“At the period referred to above, Sagista'in, as Sista‘m was then
called, practically meant the low country to the west ol Kandahir,
π Zabulistan being the name lor the upland country, now the home ol
the Berbers During the latter years ol Rustanr-he lived well over
acentury-the Persian capital was shitt‘ed from the banks oi the
Helmund to Pars, and in due course history takes the place oi legend.

“With regard to the historical existence oi Rustam, I think we
may at all events admit that there was a champion or a family ol ’
champions, who led the hosts of Iran, and furthermore, that as their
history is givdn so circumstantially almost down to historical times,
there is every probability that their exploits have asubstratum ol truth. ,
Moreover, in those days, aman bigger and heavier than his adversaries
always inspired a very wholesome leat,¹ lor not only could he deal
deadlier blows, but, equally important, he could carry heavier armour3
in lact he was like a battleship and his opponents resembled cruisers.

“The Sarangians‚ mentioned by Herodotus as belonging to the
ltth satrapy, occupied Sistan during the reign oi Darius, and the
Greek historians who narrated the conquests ol Alexander the Great,
gave the name oi Drangiana to what is now, roughly speaking,
Southern Alghanistan. This province was traversed hythe world-
conqueror on his way to Bactria and by Krateros on his march from
Karachi to Karmania. But the most ancient traveller who actually
visited and described these provinces albeit very briefly, is Isidorus ol
Charax, who was a contemporary ol Augustus, and whose account
is ol such value thatl quote it ina footnote.* We thus see that
Fara and Neh were important townS, while Gari may be Girishk.
Zarangia is the same as Sarangia, and includes Persian Sistain. The
town ol Zirra is apparently the same word which still survives in
the name ol the great lagoon mentioned below.

“Sakastani, or the land ol the liakae, is evidently the same word
as the Sistin ol today. The Sakae have disappeared irom this part

*This is §16 ol the mansiones Parthicae or Parthian Statiani.
