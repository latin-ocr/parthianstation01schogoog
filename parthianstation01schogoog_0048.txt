“ Wu-i-shan-li (apparently includes both Arachosia and Persia)
is in the west, conterminous with Li-Kan (Arabia Petraea) and T’ iao·
chih (Chaldaea).* Going somewhat over 100 days you come to the
country oi T'iao—chih, bordering on the Western sea, hot and low,
but growing rice in fields. There are large birds, eggs, resembling
urns. The country is densely populated3 it used to be governed by
petty rulers, but Parthia, reducing them to vassalage, made it ade-
pendent state. They have clever jugglers. From T'iao-chih by
water you may go west over 100 days to come near the place where
the sun sets, they say.’'
