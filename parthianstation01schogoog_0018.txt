' Jouawnr naouwn Parrum

20. (Afragment quoted from Athenaeus, ΙΙΙ, 46.) Isidore
ol Charax in his description oi Parthia says there is a certain
island in the Persian Gull where many pearls are lound3 and
that round about the island there are ralts made of reeds‚ from
which men dive into the sea to a depth ol 20 lathoms and
bring up double-shelled oysters. They say that when there
are frequent thunderstorms and heavy rains, the oyster pro-

’ duces the most young, and they get the most, the best and the

largest pearls; and in the winter the shells are accustomed to '
sink into holes in the bottom‚ but in the summer they swim
about all night with their shells open, but they close in the day-
time. And when they cling to stones and rocks in the waves
they take root and then, remaining fixed, produce the pearls,
These are engendered and nourished by something that adheres
to their flesh. lt grows in the mouth ol the oyster and has
claws and brings in food. It is like a small crab and is called
“Guardian ol the oyster.'' lts flesh'penetrates through the
center of the shell like a root; the pearl being engendered
close to it, grows through the solid portion ol the shell and
keeps growing as long as it continues to adhere to the shell.
¹ But when the flesh gets under the excrescence and cuts its way
onward‚ it gently separates the pearl from the shell and then,
when the pearl is surrounded by flesh, it is no longer nourished

- in such manner as to grow further, but the flesh 'makes it

smoother‚ more transparent and more pure. And when the
oyster lives at the bottom‚ it produces the clearest and largest
pearls3 but those that float on the surlace, because they are
affected·by the rays ol the sun‚·produce smaller pearls, ol
poorercolor„ The pearl divers run into danger when they
thrust their hands straight into the open oyster, lor it closes up
and their fingers are olten cut off, and sometimes they perish
on the spot3' but those who take them by thrusting their hands
under from one side, easily pull the shells off from the rocks.
