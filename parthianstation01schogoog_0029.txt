summanr. The scuoawus or Parasang was a Persian

measure, perhaps not altogether fixed, and may be calculated as some-
where between 3 ss and 3½ miles ; more or less, perhaps, an hour’s
travel by caravan. According to Strabo, it was equal to 140 stadia,
but varied lrom 30 to 60.

(Strabo XV, I, ll.) “When Iascended the hills, the measures

ol these schoeni were not everywhere unilorm, so that the same num-
ber sometimes designated a greater, sometimes a less actual extent ol
road, avariation which dates from the earliest time and exists in our
days. ''

Masson notes Isidore’s schoenus in Persia was about 2½ miles 3

on the Euphrates, W. Cf. Herodotus I, 66.

The STATHMOS was also a measure ol distance, but irregu-
lar, ¹depending on the nature of the country and the capability ol the

beasts ol burden.

Athenaeus (XI, 103) speaks of Amyntas as the author ol a work
on the Stations of Asia ; Eratosthenes based some ol his geographical
calculations on the “ Register of the Stathmi.’'

The modern FARSAKH in Persia is approximately the same,
3 ἦ to 4 miles.

ln general the route followed in Isidore's itinerary is from

Antioch to Birijik‚ thence down the Euphrates to Hit and across to
Seleucia on the Tigris, a sh'ort distance below Bagdad3 thence by
the modern caravan route lrom Bagdad to Hamadan, Teheran and
Nishapur, thence southward to Herat and Lake Helmund, and east-

ward to Kandahar.
ἓ Ι. ZEUGMA and APAMIA (not to be confused with the

Zeugma by Thapsacus where Alexander crossed the river, cl. Strabo,
XVI, l, 23. Zeugma means simply iord, or crossing). r

This is mentioned by Pliny, V, 21, “Zeugma, 72 miles lrom
Samosata, a fine crossing ol the Euphrates. Seleucus Nicator joined
it to Apamia on the opposite bank by a bridge.”

Strabo mentions not Apamia, but Seleucia as opposite Zeugma

(XVI, 2, 3); so Polybius V, 43, 1.
Stephanus Byz. speaks ol “Seleucus by Apamia in Syria.'' ν
Pliny (Vl, 30), speaks ol Apamia alone.
