ascending these rivers, constructed artificia} cataracta. Alexander, on
arriving there, destroyed as many ol them as he could ..... But
he bestowed great care upon the canals; lor the Euphrates, at the
commencement ol summer, overflows. It begins-to fill in the spring,
when the snow in Armenia melts3 the ploughed land, therefore,
would be covered with water and be submerged, unless the overflow'
ol the superabundant water were diverted by trenches and canals, as
in Egypt the waters oi the Nile are diverted. Hence the origin ol
canals. Great labor is requisite lor their maintenance, lor the soil is
deep, solt and yielding, so that it would easily be swept away by the
stream, the helds would be laid bare, the canals filled, and the accu-
mulation ol mud would soon obstruet their mouths.'' (XVI, I, 9.)

ἓ Ι. 171 Schoeni.

There are discrepancies in the distances given lrorn Apamia to
Seleucia. The sum ol the distances lrom Apamia to Phaliga, as
given in the text, is 54 schoeni, and that lrom Phaliga to Seleucia 100,
whereas the entire distance is stated as 171.

Miiller revises these figures by inserting 7 schoeni at the canal ol
Semiramis, where there is evidently an omissi0n3 and by altering the
second section lrom Phaliga to Seleucia, summarized in the text as
100, to agree with its footing ol 1103 which added to bl in the first
stage tallies with the 171 ol the summary. Itis suspected, however,
that there are at least two corrections to be made in the local dis-
tances; that between Anatho and Thilabus, appearing in the text as
2, may perhaps be 12 ; while that between Izan and Aipolis, 16 in
the text, may be 6. In the absence ol archaeological explorations ol
all these sites, it is impossible to determine such questions definitely.
