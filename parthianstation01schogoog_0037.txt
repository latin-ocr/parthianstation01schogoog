ἓ 7. CHARAX, is probably the modern ruin of eranukif‚

near the Caspiau Gates. Both Rhaga and Charax are now repre-
sented by the rno'dern Teheran. Charax means “palisade” or
“palisaded earthwork.'' Charax Mediae is of course not to be
confused with Charax Spasini. ⁸

ἓ 7. The MARDI, apoor but warlike people of the Elbura
range, were attacked and subdued by Phraates I, soon after his ac-
cession in B. C. 181. · They were subjects of the Seleucidae. Seleu—
cus lV (Philopator)then ruling in Syria, was too much weakened by
his father’s great war with Rome (B. C. 197-190) to offer resistance
to the Parthians, Cf. Rawlinson’s Sixtb Monarchy, IV;. Justin XLI,

a, Amas Anat. 111,.24; strabo xr, 8‚‘ 1 as, Herodotus 1, 126.
This occupatiori of a strong position west of the Caspian Gates, com-

manding the Seleucian city of Rhaga, was followed up by the next ,

Parthian king, Mithridates Ι, who greatly extended his dominions at
the expense of the Seleucidae. ’

ἓ 7. · CASPIAN MOUNTA1N; This is the Elburz range.

§l¹ CASPIAN GATEs,a remarkable pass between Easlern
and Western Asia, through which all trade and all military expeditions

had to pass. The Caspian Gates were one of the principa] strategic
points of ancient history, commanding, as they did, the highway be-
tween the East and West. At this point the Elburz mountainS, which
run generally from east to west, send out along spur south-westerly
into the desert and in this spur there are several openings through
which travelers may go to avoid the detour into the desert. The
modern route runs through the Girduni Sudurrah paSS, which Curzon
interprets as Sirdarah-Ser-i-dareh (“Head of the valley'’). The
descriptions of the pass given in the classic writers show clearly that
the modern route is not the one then used, but that the Caspian Gates
of that period were probably identical with the Teng-i-Suluk, about
four miles north of the present route. (35⁰ 20' N., 52ο Ε.) Cf. ’
Curzon, Persia I, 2935 and' authorities there quoted, also Pliny,

VI, 14.

The name was derived from the tribe of the Caspii, who gave
their name also to the Caspian Sea, known to Greek writers as the
Ι Hyrcanian Sea; cf. Rawlinson, Sixrlr Monarclry, IV.

§8. CHOARENA. The name survives in the modern
Chawar. ’

§8. APAMIA. Cf. Strabo, XI, 9, l, Xl, 13, 6, Ptolemy,
Vl, 5. Α Greek city founded by the Macedonians.
