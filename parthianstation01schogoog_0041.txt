Major Sykes (Ten Thousand Miles in Persia, p. 14) says:

‘⁴ Neh, hrst mentioned as Nie by Isidorus of Charax, is undoubt-
edlya site ol great antiquity, and must have been a place ol import-
ance, 'lying as it does on the direct line between Bandar Abbas and
the Khorasan, and within the first cultivated ar'ea struck by caravans
alter leaving Narmashir. At the present time nine routes radiate from
the town. Ancient Neh, which no traveller had hitherto discovered,
is undoubtedly what is known as Kala Shah Duzd, three miles to the
east ol the more modern lort3 it is built ona hill only accessible on
the west side, and is carelully guarded by numerous sangars· The
Ι track about hall-way up enters 'the line ol bastioned wall by passing
under a little lort which was almost a duplicate ol Kala Zarri. Above‚
lying up the steep hill-side, were thousands of houses, built ol unhewn
stone fitted together with mortar„the summit being some 600 leet
above the plain. ¹The other laces are perpendicular, but the water-
supply seemed insufficient, there being only tankS‚ so lar as could be
seen's‘ The area covered was quite four acres, and these are certainly
the most important ruins which l have examined in Eastern Persia.

‘⁸ Legend has it that Shah Duzd, or King Thin, forced Zal to v

pa'y tribute, until Rustam grew up, when th'e overlord was challenged
to'· single combat. All their weapons having been exhausted, they
wres'tl'ed until, by mutu'al consent, a halt was made lor relreshment..
Rusta'm ol subtlety indulged sparingly, but his less carelul opponent
drank'his fill, and was easily worsted, thereby sealing his own doom.

Ἴ ’ἩΝΕΙῚ grows ample supplies lor its own consumption, but as it
leedsl' all the caravans passing in other directions, it imports grain
largielylrom Sistan3 this accounts lor the number ol its mills. lts
populalion is perhaps 5000 or rather less.'’ ⁵
