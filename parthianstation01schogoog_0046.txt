Kasyapamata was the adjoining district in India proper. (See Lassen,
Ι, 142; ll, 631.)

“lt was lrom a town named Caspapyra, that Scylax of Caryanda
began his voyage oi discovery at the command ol the Persian king .
Darius. The story is given by Herodotus (lV, 44), He reiers to
the place as being ‘in the Pactyan land,' and Hecataeus calls it ‘a
city ol the Gandaraeans.’ lt could not have been lar above the
moder'n Attock (33⁰ 53' N., 72⁰ 15' E). Vincent Smith (Early
History, 32) doubts the connection ol the name with Kashmir; but
while outside the present limits oi that district, it is not impossible
that its earlier extension was wider. The fact that the Periplm dis-
tinguishes it from Gandhara points in that direction.'’

to be from his complete work, whereas the Parthian Stations, as
we have it, is rather a condensed summary.

§21-33. These fragments quoted by Pliny in his Natural

History, indicate that Isidore was the author ol aconsiderable work
on geography, now lost

§34 ARTAXERXES, possibly Artaxerxes Ochus ol the
Acbaemenid line, who' was poisoned in 338 B. C. by his general,
Bagoas 3 but this seems rather to be some Artaxerxes ol the tributary
kingdom ol Persia in Parthian times. The statements ol Isidore

do not accord with the late oi Ochus, and the event is said to have
occurred in the generation before Isidore, which was three centuries

“ later than the Achaemenid period.

§35 GOAESUS. (Compare Gaea, the ancient language oi
the Abyssinians), King oi the Omanitae in the Incense Land. This ⁸
lies in South Arabia, on either side ol the Kuria Mutia or Zenobian
Islands. Glaser has quoted inscriptions showing that alter an alliance
between the Incense Land and the Sabaeans, their enemies, the Home-
rites and the Chatramotitae were victorious, the latter seizing the rich
and productive frankincense territory, and the Abaseni migrating to
the coast ol Africa, where they established the kingdom ol Abyssinia,
long a bitter enemy ol the Homerites in Arabia· Goaesus must have
been one ol the last kings oi the Abaseni in Arabia. Cl. Glaser,
